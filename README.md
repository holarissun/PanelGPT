# PanelGPT: Prompt Language Models with a Penal Discussion

We introduce new zero-shot prompting magic words that improve language models' reasoning ability: **Panel Discussion**!

## Motivation

In conferences and workshops, there are always **penal discussions** among experts, and people exchange their opinions on a given topic, improving the understanding of new concepts, changing perspectives of thinking, and reaching a more comprehensive understanding of prevailing debates or discussions.

This idea is related to the work of self-consistency [Wang, Xuezhi, et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11171.pdf) (as multiple experts may disagree with each other during the panel discussion.)


## Empirical Results on Benchmarks

We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed prompt method on the GSM8K dataset, using gpt-3.5-turbo api.

The cost for evaluating each prompt on the 1k GSM8k test dataset is less than 2 USD.
